# PID-Monitor Dashboard

## About

Source code repository for building and hosting the PID-Monitor for Germany. A [upcoming blog post]() introduces the 
aim of the dashboard and some key functionalities.

The dashboards are built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), an open source tool for scientific and 
technical publishing. Quarto documents contain text and analytical source code, in our case R, and are 
rendered to HTML. More specifically, we created parameterised reports from which Quarto generates 
publisher-specific views. 


## The PID Network Germany Project

The [PID Network Germany](https://pid-network.de) project is the central dialog and information platform of the
project "PID Network Germany- Network for the Promotion of Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) in Science and Culture" 
funded by the [German Research Foundation](https://dfg.de) (DFG), project 
number: [506475377](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/506475377).
The platform bundles central information on PIDs and supports the project's public relations work as 
well as knowledge transfer on the topic. The information focuses on [10 different use cases of PIDs](https://www.pid-network.de/en/pid-sections#c5389). 
On the pages you will find information on the cases in which PIDs are useful, which PIDs are available for 
the respective use case and where they can be applied for.

Within the project duration, it will be successively extended by information on international standards, best practices, FAQs and consulting services.
In addition, news on the development, application and implementation of PIDs will be communicated via the mailing list "PID Dialog" as well as our project social media channels on Mastodon and Twitter. We look forward to you following us here.

# Source Code

We intend to make the source code of the dashboard publicly here available.
This will not only enhance transparency but also enable collaboration, allowing others to contribute to its further development
and adaptation to different use cases.
